Neolithic architecture is the architecture of the Neolithic period  Although many dwellings belonging to all prehistoric periods and also some clay models of dwellings have been uncovered enabling us to make faithful reconstructions they seldom included elements that may relate them to art  Some exceptions are provided by wall decorations and by finds that equally apply to Neolithic and Eneolithic rites and art

In South and Southwest Asia Neolithic cultures appear soon after 10000BC initially in the Levant Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B and from there spread eastwards and westwards  There are early Neolithic cultures in Southeast Anatolia Syria and Iraq by 8000BC and food-producing societies first appear in southeast Europe by 7000BC and Central Europe by 5500BC of which the earliest cultural complexes include the Starčevo-Koros Cris Linearbandkeramic and Vinča  With the exception of the Andes the Isthmo-Columbian area and Western Mesoamerica and a few copper hatchets and spear heads in the Great Lakes region the people of the Americas and the Pacific remained at the Neolithic level of technology up until the time of Western contact

Neolithic settlements and cities include

Göbekli Tepe in Turkey 9000BC
Jericho in the Levant Neolithic from around 8350BC arising from the earlier Epipaleolithic Natufian culture
Nevali Cori in Turkey 8000BC
Çatalhöyük in Turkey 7500BC
Mehrgarh in Pakistan 7000BC
Knap of Howar and Skara Brae the Orkney Islands Scotland from 3500BC
over 3000 settlements of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture some with populations up to 15000 residents flourished in present-day Romania Moldova and Ukraine from 5400–2800BC
The neolithic people in the Levant Anatolia Syria northern Mesopotamia and Central Asia were great builders utilizing mud-brick to construct houses and villages  At Çatalhöyük houses were plastered and painted with elaborate scenes of humans and animals  The Mediterranean neolithic cultures of Malta worshiped in megalithic temples

In Europe long houses built from wattle and daub were constructed  Elaborate tombs for the dead were also built  These tombs are particularly numerous in Ireland where there are many thousands still in existence  Neolithic people in the British Isles built long barrows and chamber tombs for their dead and causewayed camps

Surviving examples of medieval secular architecture mainly served for defense  Castles and fortified walls provide the most notable remaining non-religious examples of medieval architecture  Windows gained a cross-shape for more than decorative purposes: they provided a perfect fit for a crossbowman to safely shoot at invaders from inside  Crenellation walls battlements provided shelters for archers on the roofs to hide behind when not shooting  henges flint mines and cursus monuments

Western European architecture in the Early Middle Ages may be divided into Early Christian and Pre-Romanesque including Merovingian Carolingian Ottonian and Asturian  While these terms are problematic they nonetheless serve adequately as entries into the era  Considerations that enter into histories of each period include Trachtenberg's historicising and modernising elements Italian versus northern Spanish and Byzantine elements and especially the religious and political maneuverings between kings popes and various ecclesiastic officials

Romanesque
Main article: Romanesque architecture

Karlštejn is a large Gothic castle founded 1348 by Charles IV Holy Roman Emperor
Romanesque prevalent in medieval Europe during the 11th and 12th centuries was the first pan-European style since Roman Imperial architecture and examples are found in every part of the continent  The term was not contemporary with the art it describes but rather is an invention of modern scholarship based on its similarity to Roman architecture in forms and materials  Romanesque is characterized by a use of round or slightly pointed arches barrel vaults and cruciform piers supporting vaults

Gothic
Main article: Gothic architecture
The various elements of Gothic architecture emerged in a number of 11th- and 12th-century building projects particularly in the Île de France area but were first combined to form what we would now recognise as a distinctively Gothic style at the 12th-century abbey church of Saint-Denis in Saint-Denis near Paris  Verticality is emphasized in Gothic architecture which features almost skeletal stone structures with great expanses of glass pared-down wall surfaces supported by external flying buttresses pointed arches using the ogive shape ribbed stone vaults clustered columns pinnacles and sharply pointed spires  Windows contain beautiful stained glass showing stories from the Bible and from lives of saints  Such advances in design allowed cathedrals to rise taller than ever and it became something of an inter-regional contest to build a church as high as possible

The Renaissance often refers to the Italian Renaissance that began in the 14th century but recent research has revealed the existence of similar movements around Europe before the 15th century; consequently the term Early Modern has gained popularity in describing this cultural movement  This period of cultural rebirth is often credited with the restoration of scholarship in the Classical Antiquities and the absorption of new scientific and philosophical knowledge that fed the arts

The development from Medieval architecture concerned the way geometry mediated between the intangibility of light and the tangibility of the material as a way of relating divine creation to mortal existence  This relationship was changed in some measure by the invention of Perspective which brought a sense of infinity into the realm of human comprehension through the new representations of the horizon evidenced in the expanses of space opened up in Renaissance painting and helped shape new humanist thought

Perspective represented a new understanding of space as a universal a priori fact understood and controllable through human reason  Renaissance buildings therefore show a different sense of conceptual clarity where spaces were designed to be understood in their entirety from a specific fixed viewpoint  The power of Perspective to universally represent reality was not limited to describing experiences but also allowed it to anticipate experience itself by projecting the image back into reality

The Renaissance spread to France in the late 15th century when Charles VIII returned in 1496 with several Italian artists from his conquest of Naples  Renaissance chateaux were built in the Loire Valley the earliest example being the Château d'Amboise and the style became dominant under Francis I 1515–47  See Châteaux of the Loire Valley  The Château de Chambord is a combination of Gothic structure and Italianate ornament a style which progressed under architects such as Sebastiano Serlio who was engaged after 1540 in work at the Château de Fontainebleau

Architects such as Philibert Delorme Androuet du Cerceau Giacomo Vignola and Pierre Lescot were inspired by the new ideas  The southwest interior facade of the Cour Carree of the Louvre in Paris was designed by Lescot and covered with exterior carvings by Jean Goujon  Architecture continued to thrive in the reigns of Henry II and Henry III

In England the first great exponent of Renaissance architecture was Inigo Jones 1573–1652 who had studied architecture in Italy where the influence of Palladio was very strong  Jones returned to England full of enthusiasm for the new movement and immediately began to design such buildings as the Queen's House at Greenwich in 1616 and the Banqueting House at Whitehall three years later  These works with their clean lines and symmetry were revolutionary in a country still enamoured with mullion windows crenellations and turrets

With the rise of various European colonial empires from the 16th century onward through the early 20th century the new stylistic trends of Europe were exported to or adopted by locations around the world often evolving into new regional variations

Baroque architecture
Main article: Baroque architecture
The periods of Mannerism and the Baroque that followed the Renaissance signaled an increasing anxiety over meaning and representation  Important developments in science and philosophy had separated mathematical representations of reality from the rest of culture fundamentally changing the way humans related to their world through architecture [citation needed] It would reach its most extreme and embellished development under the decorative tastes of Rococo

In the late 17th and 18th centuries the works and theories of Andrea Palladio from 16th-century Venice would again be interpreted and adopted in England spread by the English translation of his I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura and pattern books such as Vitruvius Brittanicus by Colen Campbell  This Palladian architecture and continued classical imagery would in turn go on to influence Thomas Jefferson and other early architects of the United States in their search for a new national architecture

By the mid-18th century there tended to be more restrained decoration and usage of authentic classical forms than in the Baroque informed by increased visitation to classical ruins as part of the Grand Tour coupled with the excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum

Federal-style architecture is the name for the classicizing architecture built in North America between 1780 and 1830 and particularly from 1785 to 1815  This style shares its name with its era the Federal Period  The term is also used in association with furniture design in the United States of the same time period  The style broadly corresponds to the middle-class classicism of Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands Regency style in Britain and to the French Empire style

Beaux-Arts architecture denotes the academic classical architectural style that was taught at the École des Beaux Arts in Paris  The style Beaux-Arts is above all the cumulative product of two and a half centuries of instruction under the authority first of the Académie royale d'architecture then following the Revolution of the Architecture section of the Académie des Beaux-Arts  The organization under the Ancien Régime of the competition for the Grand Prix de Rome in architecture offering a chance to study in Rome imprinted its codes and esthetic on the course of instruction which culminated during the Second Empire 1850–1870 and the Third Republic that followed  The style of instruction that produced Beaux-Arts architecture continued without a major renovation until 1968

The Romans conquered the Greek cities in Italy around three hundred years BCE and much of the Western world after that. The Roman problem of rulership involved the unity of disparity — from Spanish to Greek, Macedonian to Carthaginian — Roman rule had extended itself across the breadth of the known world and the myriad pacified cultures forming this ecumene presented a new challenge for justice.

One way to look at the unity of Roman architecture is through a new-found realization of theory derived from practice, and embodied spatially. Civically we find this happening in the Roman forum (sibling of the Greek agora), where public participation is increasingly removed from the concrete performance of rituals and represented in the decor of the architecture. Thus we finally see the beginnings of the contemporary public square in the Forum Iulium, begun by Julius Caesar, where the buildings present themselves through their facades as representations within the space.

As the Romans chose representations of sanctity over actual sacred spaces to participate in society, the communicative nature of space was opened to human manipulation. None of which would have been possible without the advances of Roman engineering and construction or the newly found marble quarries which were the spoils of war; inventions like the arch and concrete gave a whole new form to Roman architecture, fluidly enclosing space in taut domes and colonnades, clothing the grounds for imperial rulership and civic order. This was also a response to the changing social climate which demanded new buildings of increasing complexity — the colosseum, the residential block, bigger hospitals and academies. General civil construction such as roads and bridges began to be built.

The Romans widely employed, and further developed, the arch, vault and dome (see the Roman Architectural Revolution), all of which were little used before, particularly in Europe.[8] Their innovative use of Roman concrete facilitated the building of the many public buildings of often unprecedented size throughout the empire. These include Roman temples, Roman baths, Roman bridges, Roman aqueducts, Roman harbours, triumphal arches, Roman amphitheatres, Roman circuses palaces, mausolea and in the late empire also churches.

Roman domes permitted construction of vaulted ceilings and enabled huge covered public spaces such as the public baths like Baths of Diocletian or the monumental Pantheon in the city of Rome.

Art historians such as Gottfried Richter in the 1920s identified the Roman architectural innovation as being the Triumphal Arch and it is poignant to see how this symbol of power on earth was transformed and utilized within the Christian basilicas when the Roman Empire of the West was on its last legs: The arch was set before the altar to symbolize the triumph of Christ and the after life. It is in their impressive aqueducts that we see the arch triumphant, especially in the many surviving examples, such as the Pont du Gard, the aqueduct at Segovia and the remains of the Aqueducts of Rome itself. Their survival is testimony to the durability of their materials and design.

The Byzantine Empire gradually emerged as a distinct artistic and cultural entity from the Roman Empire after AD 330, when the Roman Emperor Constantine moved the capital of the Roman Empire east from Rome to Byzantium (later renamed Constantinople and now called Istanbul). The empire endured for more than a millennium, dramatically influencing Medieval and Renaissance-era architecture in Europe and, following the capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, leading directly to the architecture of the Ottoman Empire.

Early Byzantine architecture was built as a continuation of Roman architecture. Stylistic drift, technological advancement, and political and territorial changes meant that a distinct style gradually emerged which imbued certain influences from the Near East and used the Greek cross plan in church architecture. Buildings increased in geometric complexity, brick and plaster were used in addition to stone in the decoration of important public structures, classical orders were used more freely, mosaics replaced carved decoration, complex domes rested upon massive piers, and windows filtered light through thin sheets of alabaster to softly illuminate interiors. (see Hagia Sophia)

The pre-Islamic styles draw on 3-4 thousand years of architectural development from various civilizations of the Iranian plateau. The Islamic architecture of Iran in turn, draws ideas from its pre-Islamic predecessor, and has geometrical and repetitive forms, as well as surfaces that are richly decorated with glazed tiles, carved stucco, patterned brickwork, floral motifs, and calligraphy. Iran is recognized by UNESCO as being one of the cradles of civilization.[9]

Each of the periods of Elamites, Achaemenids, Parthians, and Sassanids were creators of great architecture that over the ages has spread wide and far to other cultures being adopted. Although Iran has suffered its share of destruction, including Alexander The Great's decision to burn Persepolis, there are sufficient remains to form a picture of its classical architecture.

The Achaemenids built on a grand scale. The artists and materials they used were brought in from practically all territories of what was then the largest state in the world. Pasargadae set the standard: its city was laid out in an extensive park with bridges, gardens, colonnaded palaces and open column pavilions. Pasargadae along with Susa and Persepolis expressed the authority of The King of Kings, the staircases of the latter recording in relief sculpture the vast extent of the imperial frontier.

With the emergence of the Parthians and Sassanids there was an appearance of new forms. Parthian innovations fully flowered during the Sassanid period with massive barrel-vaulted chambers, solid masonry domes, and tall columns. This influence was to remain for years to come. The roundness of the city of Baghdad in the Abbasid era for example, points to its Persian precedents such as Firouzabad in Fars.[10] The two designers who were hired by al-Mansur to plan the city's design were Naubakht, a former Persian Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious, and Mashallah, a former Jew from Khorasan. The ruins of Persepolis, Ctesiphon, Jiroft,[11] Sialk, Pasargadae, Firouzabad, Arg-é Bam, and thousands of other ruins may give us merely a distant glimpse of what contribution Persians made to the art of building.

The fall of the Sassanid Empire to invading Islamic forces ironically led to the creation of remarkable religious buildings in Iran. Arts such as calligraphy, stucco work, mirror work, and mosaic work, became closely tied with architecture in Iran in the new era. Archaeological excavations have provided sufficient documents in support of the impacts of Sasanian architecture on the architecture of the Islamic world. Many experts believe the period of Persian architecture from the 15th through 17th Centuries to be the most brilliant of the post-Islamic era. Various structures such as mosques, mausoleums, bazaars, bridges, and different palaces have mainly survived from this period.

In the old Persian architecture, semi-circular and oval-shaped vaults were of great interest, leading Safavi architects to display their extraordinary skills in making massive domes. In the words of D. Huff, a German archaeologist, the dome is the dominant element in Persian architecture. Domes can be seen frequently in the structure of bazaars and mosques, particularly during the Safavi period in Isfahan. Iranian domes are distinguished for their height, proportion of elements, beauty of form, and roundness of the dome stem. The outer surfaces of the domes are mostly mosaic faced, and create a magical view. Safavi Isfahan tried to achieve grandeur in scale (Isfahan's Naghsh-i Jahan Square is the 6th largest square worldwide) knowledge about building tall buildings with vast inner spaces. However, the quality of ornaments was decreased in comparison with those of the 14th and 15th centuries.

The great mosques of Khorasan, Isfahan, and Tabriz each used local geometry, local materials, and local building methods to express in their own ways the order, harmony, and unity of Islamic architecture. And thus when the major monuments of Islamic Persian architecture are examined, they reveal complex geometrical relationships, a studied hierarchy of form and ornament, and great depths of symbolic meaning.

Throughout the medieval period, Aksumite architecture and influences and its monolithic tradition persisted, with its influence strongest in the early medieval (Late Aksumite) and Zagwe periods (when the churches of Lalibela were carved). Throughout the medieval period, and especially from the 10th to 12th centuries, churches were hewn out of rock throughout Ethiopia, especially during the northernmost region of Tigray, which was the heart of the Aksumite Empire. However, rock-hewn churches have been found as far south as Adadi Maryam (15th century), about 100 km south of Addis Abeba. The most famous example of Ethiopian rock-hewn architecture are the 11 monolithic churches of Lalibela, carved out of the red volcanic tuff found around the town. Though later medieval hagiographies attribute all 11 structures to the eponymous King Lalibela (the town was called Roha and Adefa before his reign), new evidence indicates that they may have been built separately over a period of a few centuries, with only a few of the more recent churches having been built under his reign. Archaeologist and Ethiopisant David Phillipson postulates, for instance, that Bete Gebriel-Rufa'el was actually built in the very early medieval period, some time between 600 and 800 A.D., originally as a fortress but was later turned into a church.[13]

During the early modern period, the absorption of new diverse influences such as Baroque, Arab, Turkish and Gujarati Indian style began with the arrival of Portuguese Jesuit missionaries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Portuguese soldiers had initially come in the mid-16th century as allies to aid Ethiopia in its fight against Adal, and later Jesuits came hoping to convert the country. Some Turkish influence may have entered the country during the late 16th century during its war with the Ottoman Empire (see Habesh), which resulted in an increased building of fortresses and castles. Ethiopia, naturally easily defensible because of its numerous ambas or flat-topped mountains and rugged terrain, yielded little tactical use from the structures in contrast to their advantages in the flat terrain of Europe and other areas, and so had until this point little developed the tradition. Castles were built especially beginning with the reign of Sarsa Dengel around the Lake Tana region, and subsequent Emperors maintained the tradition, eventually resulting in the creation of the Fasil Ghebbi (royal enclosure of castles) in the newly founded capital (1635), Gondar. Emperor Susenyos (r.1606-1632) converted to Catholicism in 1622 and attempted to make it the state religion, declaring it as such from 1624 until his abdication; during this time, he employed Arab, Gujarati (brought by the Jesuits), and Jesuit masons and their styles, as well as local masons, some of whom were Beta Israel. With the reign of his son Fasilides, most of these foreigners were expelled, although some of their architectural styles were absorbed into the prevailing Ethiopian architectural style. This style of the Gondarine dynasty would persist throughout the 17th and 18th centuries especially and also influenced modern 19th-century and later styles.

Great Zimbabwe is the largest medieval city in sub-Saharan Africa. By the late nineteenth century, most buildings reflected the fashionable European eclecticism and pastisched Mediterranean, or even Northern European, styles.

In the Western Sahel region, Islamic influence was a major contributing factor to architectural development from the later ages of the Kingdom of Ghana. At Kumbi Saleh, locals lived in domed-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques, as described by al-bakri, with one centered on Friday prayer.[14] The king is said to have owned several mansions, one of which was sixty-six feet long, forty-two feet wide, contained seven rooms, was two stories high, and had a staircase; with the walls and chambers filled with sculpture and painting.[15]

Sahelian architecture initially grew from the two cities of Djenné and Timbuktu. The Sankore Mosque in Timbuktu, constructed from mud on timber, was similar in style to the Great Mosque of Djenné. The rise of kingdoms in the West African coastal region produced architecture which drew on indigenous traditions, utilizing wood. The famed Benin City, destroyed by the Punitive Expedition, was a large complex of homes in coursed clay, with hipped roofs of shingles or palm leaves. The Palace had a sequence of ceremonial rooms, and was decorated with brass plaques.

A common type of houses in Sub-Saharian Africa were the Beehive houses, made from a circle of stones topped with a domed roof. The ancient Bantu used this type of house, which was made with mud, poles, and cow dung

Indian architecture encompasses a wide variety of geographically and historically spread structures, and was transformed by the history of the Indian subcontinent. The result is an evolving range of architectural production that, although it is difficult to identify a single representative style, nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history. The diversity of Indian culture is represented in its architecture. It is a blend of ancient and varied native traditions, with building types, forms and technologies from West and Central Asia, as well as Europe. Architectural styles range from Hindu temple architecture to Islamic architecture to western classical architecture to modern and post-modern architecture.

India's Urban Civilization is traceable originally to Mohenjodaro and Harappa, now in Pakistan. From then on, Indian architecture and civil engineering continued to develop, manifesting in temples, palaces and forts across the Indian subcontinent and neighbouring regions. Architecture and civil engineering was known as sthapatya-kala, literally "the art of constructing".
