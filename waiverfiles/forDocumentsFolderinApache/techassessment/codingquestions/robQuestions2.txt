Hey Paul and Gerry,

I changed the pandas question to look at a bigger data and do some aggregations. Here is the verbiage (also added to the google doc):

Download this data file to answer the question:
https://drive.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/file/d/1W9jlWSO3KyyBn2oV7WlfcNwCODD_LgfK/view?usp=sharing

This file contains 2019 oil & gas production values. The file is taken directly from the source with some small modifications - the data is **not** cleaned! The data dictionary/schema for this file is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q--1GyPru98oXybpyR6w5lhuens9KetcI1Fef5fS9lM/edit?usp=sharing
Using the above data file and the pandas library answer the following questions:

- In 2019, which month had the most oil production? (Answer as a single integer: like 1 instead of 'January')
- In 2019, what operator number had the most total gas production? (Answer as a single integer: the operator number)
- In 2019, what was the total gas flared? (Answer as a single integer: the total gas flared rounded up to the nearest whole number)
- In 2019, what was the average gas production per day? (Answer as a single integer: the average gas production rounded up to the nearest whole number)
- In 2019, what county had the most oil & gas wells operating? (Answer as a single integer: the API county code)

Question Objectives:
- reading in the file / understanding the data dictionary
- date formatting: month/year combined into a string that will require conversion to a datetime
- filtering: as the file also include 'update' records for other years that need filtered out
- groupby / aggs to directly answer the questions

What do you think?

Cheers,
Rob
