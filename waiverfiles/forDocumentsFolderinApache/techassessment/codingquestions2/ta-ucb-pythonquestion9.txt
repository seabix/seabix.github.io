<p>
For this question use the code below to make an array named ar. Using this array please write-in the answer to each of these questions:

<code>import numpy as np<br />
np.random.seed(25)<br />
ar = np.random.randn(1000)<br />
ar = ar * 100<br />
ar = ar.astype('int8')<br />
ar = ar.reshape((200, 5))</code>
</p>

<p>
This is a sequence of questions:
<ol>
	<li>Using numpy, find the max value, min value and mean of the array <code>ar</code>.</li>
	<li>Using numpy, what is the number at the position of the 8th row and 2nd column of the array <code>ar</code>.</li>
	<li>Using numpy, how many numbers in the array <code>ar</code> are above the mean.</li>
	<li>Using numpy, what is the sum of the values of the array <code>ar</code> that are greater than -5 above and less than or equal to 20.</li>
	<li>Using numpy, what is the position of the max value of the array <code>ar</code>. Give the answer as a tuple like: (10,3)</li>
</ol>
